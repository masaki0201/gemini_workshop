Abstract
Over the last few years, there has been a growing interest in interdisciplinary studies with the aim of understanding shades in management research fields. Building on Resource Based View (RBV), this study explores the intricate relationship between entrepreneurs’ personality traits, prior entrepreneurial experience, and entrepreneurs’ resilience within the context of Italian startups. Specifically, we investigate how the Big Five personality traits – namely extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience – influence the entrepreneur’s resilience by verifying whether and to what extent there is a moderation effect, due to the prior experience in entrepreneurship. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using survey data from 141 Italian startup entrepreneurs, focusing on the fiscal year 2022. Factor scores derived from a Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) analysis with an Oblimin rotation were used. The empirical evidence of the OLS regressions with bootstrapping shows that prior experience acts as a moderator in the relationship between the first factor (i.e., emotional stability and conscientiousness) and resilience. While direct and indirect effects of the second factor (i.e., openness and extraversion) on resilience were not significant. At the level of individual items, personality revealed that conscientiousness and emotional stability predict resilience only if considered together. Our study holds theoretical and practical implications. Theoretical implications extend the scope of RBV to encompass individual-level traits and cognitive aspects, providing a deeper understanding of resilience antecedents. From the practical standpoint, our results emphasize the pivotal role of self-awareness and experiential learning for entrepreneurs and startup founders, suggesting that resilience might be cultivated through reflective practices and learning from past endeavours. For policymakers, our research highlights the need for initiatives that nurture entrepreneurs’ resilience and promote startups’ adaptation in changing environments.

Personal factors, entrepreneurial intention, and entrepreneurial status: A multinational study in three institutional environments
Article 25 March 2021
Introduction
The main characteristic that pools the overwhelmingly of firms is the dynamic and changing environment in which they operate. In such a scenario, this volatility leads them to reconvert and adapt strategies, structures, and behaviours to uncover new business opportunities (Acs et al., 2017; Acs & Audretsch, 1987; Sherif, 2006). In this vein, several successful startups have been founded in times of crisis since by capitalizing on hidden opportunities. (Bullough et al., 2014). For instance, some scholars examined the startups’ response during the spread of COVID-19 by means of resilience (Brown & Rocha, 2020; Kuckertz et al., 2020; Mota et al., 2022).

Prior research on entrepreneurial resilience has predominantly focused on immediate adaptability and crisis management by exploring how resilience enables entrepreneurs to withstand short-term challenges, such as economic downturns and market instability (Bullough et al., 2014). Ayala and Manzano (2014) delved into the influence of resilience on overcoming operational adversities, such as financial constraints and resource limitations. While the influence of personality traits on resilience has gained increasing recognition in recent research, there remains a critical gap in considering the cognitive aspects of entrepreneurs, particularly their experiences. Seminal works by Ayala and Manzano (2014) and Rauch and Frese (2007) underscored the influence of personality traits on resilience, but they often do not fully account for how an entrepreneur’s cognition shaped by their experiences, further influences this resilience. This oversight is significant, as it overlooks the complex interplay between inherent personality traits and experiential learning in shaping resilience.

Entrepreneurial resilience is not only a set of inherent personality traits but also a result of the entrepreneur’s experiences (Windle, 2011), which play a crucial role in configuring their cognitive framework and strategic orientation. Specifically, prior experience in entrepreneurship provides a valuable context for the development and strengthening of resilience. Such experiences contribute to an entrepreneur’s ability to effectively interpret and navigate business challenges, enhancing their strategic decision-making processes (Doni et al., 2020; Duchek, 2018).

In light of the foregoing statements, our study seeks to bridge these shortcomings not only by corroborating the relationship between personality traits and entrepreneur’s resilience, but also by verifying how cognitive aspect, such as prior experience, affects the baseline relationship. Accordingly, we intend to move the current body of knowledge forward by exploring the following research questions:

RQ1: “What is the influence of entrepreneur’s personality traits on entrepreneurial resilience in the startup context?”

RQ2: “Is previous experience in entrepreneurship able to moderate such relationship, and to what extent?”

In so doing, we positioned our study in the Resource Based View (hereafter RBV). Such a theoretical framework asserts that the firm’s internal resources and capabilities are the main drivers of the competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Barney et al., 2001; Wernerfelt, 1984). In this scenario, companies should implement business strategies able to capitalize on their valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (i.e., VRIN framework) resources. Firms can accomplish this by leveraging core competencies, developing new capabilities, or investing in resource enhancement. These actions help to preserve long-term profitability, including the ability to design and implement successful business models (Lockett et al., 2009).

To explore the earlier research hypotheses, we use data collected through a survey methodology on a sample of 141 Italian startups where the entrepreneur was the key respondent. Indeed, the latter is the key person who runs a venture and leans to perform in risky, challenging, and dynamic conditions (Carland et al., 1984). The present research is a cross-sectional study, given that the sample is based on just the fiscal year 2022. The hypotheses are tested utilizing the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2017) in SPSS for moderated analysis, employing bootstrapping with 5,000 samples to provide robust confidence intervals for indirect effects.

The study delves into the multifaced relationship between entrepreneurs’ personality traits and their resilience. Specifically, it underscores the pivotal role of cognitive aspects, such as prior experience, in shaping this relationship. Indeed, by examining how previous experience in entrepreneurship moderates the base relationship, our study sheds light on the complex interplay between inherent traits and experiential learning. Through the lens of the RBV, this research sheds light on how startups can achieve and sustain a competitive advantage by leveraging their unique strengths, including resilience fostered by both personality traits and prior experience. The rationale of the research assumes that internal resources such as personality traits might support startups build and maintain a competitive advantage, which could be further preserved by cultivating entrepreneurial resilience to achieve long-term success and stability in a dynamic business environment. Employing survey methodology, this study provides tangible evidence of the determinants that could affect entrepreneurs’ resilience. This contribution therefore offers a contextual lens through which to understand how startups in Italy, and potentially in other contexts, adapt and succeed against challenges.

The findings of this analysis hold some theoretical and practical implications. From the theoretical point of view, this research enriches the RBV by expanding its application to the domain of entrepreneurial resilience. Traditionally, RBV spotlights the relevance of internal resources, such as tangible and intangible assets or capabilities, to achieve and preserve competitive advantage. However, this study broadens the theory’s scope by incorporating individual-level traits and highlights the role of cognitive aspects in resilience as critical internal antecedents. From a practical outlook, the study empathizes with entrepreneurs and startup founders on the critical nature of self-awareness concerning their personality traits and the instrumental role of their prior experiences. It suggests that resilience, crucial for thriving in a volatile context, could be cultivated, and strengthened through reflective practices and learning from past entrepreneurial endeavours. For policymakers, the findings underscore the need for educational programs that nurture entrepreneurs’ resilience, such as mentorship programs with experienced entrepreneurs or workshops on strategic adaptation and resilience reinforcement. For investors, this research offers a framework to evaluate potential investments, suggesting that startups led by resilient entrepreneurs, especially those with a combination of relevant personality traits and experiences, may be more adaptable and successful over the long term.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes the theoretical background and the development of hypotheses. Section 3 describes the quantitative method employed in the empirical study. Section 4 exhibits the findings, while Section 5 discusses the conclusions, limitations, and future research routes.

Theoretical foundations and hypotheses development
Entrepreneur’s resilience
Resilience is “the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing significant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and ‘bouncing back’ in the face of adversity” (Windle, 2011, p. 1). However, even if resilience has been conceptualised in different research fields, it is rooted in the psychological strand: on the one hand, it recalls “an ability to go on with life, or to continue living a purposeful life, after hardship or adversity” (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004, p. 4); and on the other hand, it is “a dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity” (Luthar et al., 2000, p.543).

When we transition this concept into the entrepreneurial domain, resilience becomes a critical construct for understanding entrepreneurial intention, firm survival, and innovation. In this context, resilience transcends individual capacity, incorporating organizational and strategic dimensions (Bullough et al., 2014; Monllor & Murphy, 2017). Entrepreneurs, by their very nature, face a multitude of uncertainties and challenges. The ability to innovate, adapt, and recover from setbacks is not merely a desirable trait but a fundamental aspect of sustaining competitive advantage and ensuring the survival and growth of their ventures (Corvino et al., 2019; Ferraris et al., 2017; Windle, 2011). Indeed, resilience is intrinsically associated with innovation and plays a significant role in the organizational capacity to adapt to new circumstances (Lai et al., 2016) since it involves the ability to re-envision business models, reconfigure resources and routines, and innovate in response to external threats and opportunities (Scuotto et al., 2017). The entrepreneurial resilience, therefore, represents a strategic attitude that is critical for new venture creation, the maintenance of competitive advantage, and the overall resilience of the business ecosystem (Linnenluecke, 2017; Teece, 2018). This means that resilient ventures can perform adjustments under challenging scenarios and discover new opportunities by analyzing environmental change (Boyne & Meier, 2009; Cheng et al., 2014).

Building on this line of thought, which encapsulates the concept of resilience as a vital internal resource for both the entrepreneur and their venture, we opt for the RBV theory. Overall, RBV focuses on how companies achieve and sustain competitive advantage through their VRIN resources. However, in the present study, we expand its scope to encompass the experiential and cognitive dimensions of entrepreneurial resilience as critical internal resources for startups. Specifically, we posit that entrepreneurial resilience is a crucial intangible resource that can drive competitive advantage.

Despite the relevance of this theme in several research fields, thin attention has been devoted to management research field (Santoro et al., 2021). Firms are subjected to wide risk and changing future, defined by both internal and external uncertainty, often due to overwhelmingly market fluctuations, as well as technological and social irregularities (Ardito et al., 2016; Gorgievski & Stephan, 2016). In cultivating resilience and adaptability, they might improve their risk tolerance and their capacity to proactively conform to environmental uncertainty (Del Giudice et al., 2017). In line with this perspective, we posit that an entrepreneur’s resilience is a valuable attribute, because of its potential to be transmitted from entrepreneurs to their ventures. Indeed, our investigation into entrepreneurial resilience is further motivated by the imprinting literature (Bryant, 2014), which suggests that the characteristics of entrepreneurs leave a lasting imprint on the ventures they create. This transmission process suggests that the resilience of entrepreneurs can significantly contribute to the resilience of the ventures they lead, enabling these businesses to better navigate and overcome adverse conditions (Marshall, 1993).

Taking all the views together, it might be proper to consider resilience in our conceptual model for several reasons (Fig. 1). Firstly, some scholars have verified that resilience influences firm strategy and performance (Anglin et al., 2018; Williams & Vorley, 2014; Youssef & Luthans, 2007); secondly, even though being a key component in entrepreneurship literature, little emphasis has been devoted to management studies; lastly, when considering the personality traits, entrepreneurial resilience should deserve the same attention paid to the theoretical construct of entrepreneurial intentions (Murugesan & Jayavelu, 2017; Schlaegel et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2010).

Antecedents of resilience: the big five personality traits
The interplay between personality traits and entrepreneurial resilience presents a fertile ground for scholarly investigation. Studies by Farradinna et al. (2019) and Schutte and Mberi (2020) have begun to peel back the layers of how inherent personality characteristics play a pivotal role in shaping an entrepreneur’s capacity to withstand and thrive amidst adversities. This growing body of research suggests a nuanced interconnection between the fabric of an individual’s personality and their resilience, highlighting the potential for certain traits to bolster an entrepreneur’s ability to navigate the unpredictable waters of entrepreneurship.

Despite these valuable insights, the field still needs a deeper, more granular understanding of the specific personality dimensions and their direct impact on resilience. Therefore, our study seeks to build upon this foundation by delving into the nuances of the Big-Five Framework (BFF) and its relationship with entrepreneur’s resilience. Over the last years, such model was endorsed as a robust path of personality traits (Costa & McCrae, 2008; Digman, 1990) and it is currently the prevailing approach to describe the configuration of human traits. The BFF categorizes personality into five broad dimensions, namely extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience. This conceptual framework serves as an effective tool for understanding the complex interplay.

Building on the earlier cues, we opted for an overall overview of the BFF to verify the research hypotheses posited in our quantitative analysis.

Extraversion
Extraversion refers to individuals who tend to be sociable, dominant, ambitious, assertive, as well as oriented to leadership roles (Judge et al., 1998) and to power of relationships. Such personality trait enables entrepreneur to enrich social networks more efficiently (e.g., strong partnerships with stakeholders). In this perspective, extraversion can enhance an entrepreneur’s ability to build effective networks and relationships (Zhao et al., 2010), providing a supportive resource base crucial for coping with challenges and supporting the resilience-building process. Therefore, we surmised a linkage with entrepreneur’s resilience, since the extraversion elements improve the attitude for risk tolerance and proactivity to environmental uncertainty (Arenius et al., 2021; Caliendo et al., 2014; Hrazdil et al., 2020; Pinjisakikool, 2018). Thereby, we postulated that (Fig. 1):

H1a: Extraversion is positively related to entrepreneur’s resilience.

Agreeableness
Agreeableness is used to appraise the individual’s manner and behaviour toward other people. Entrepreneurs with higher agreeableness are defined as trusting, altruistic, sympathetic, and cooperative. Conversely, those who with lower agreeableness might be irritable, manipulative, ruthless, and self-centered (Ciavarella et al., 2004). In the academic debate, there are mixed findings with respect to firm’s survival. In particular, some scholars argued that agreeableness might have a negative or positive effect (Schmitt-Rodermund, 2004; Zhao & Seibert, 2006); while others assume that agreeableness does not influence entrepreneurial survival (Ciavarella et al., 2004). In accordance with Billingsley et al. (2023), we assumed the following hypothesis (Fig. 1):

H1b: Agreeableness is positively related to entrepreneur’s resilience.

Conscientiousness
Conscientiousness is a personality trait that portrays an individual’s level of achievement orientation, work motivation, planning, self-control and agreement with traditional norms, and accountability toward others (Costa & McCrae, 2008). In some studies, the need for achievement positively affects entrepreneurial survival (Zhao & Seibert, 2006). Consistently with McClelland’s (1961) study, we expect that the need for achievement implements the incentive of individuals to seek new solutions than those given in a specific context. Furthermore, conscientiousness, with its emphasis on diligence and responsibility, is likely crucial in developing effective coping strategies and maintaining persistence in the face of adversity (Barrick & Mount, 1991). Therefore, our hypothesis is posited as follows:

H1c: Conscientiousness is positively related to entrepreneur’s resilience.

Emotional Stability
Emotional Stability is a personality attribute describing the individual’s level of autonomy, independence, and individualism. These personality traits are associated with entrepreneurship and operate as a significant motivator (Collins et al., 1979). Emotional stability positively sways both maintaining relationships with stakeholders (Ciavarella et al., 2004) and entrepreneurial risk-taking (Schlaegel et al., 2021), potentially equipping entrepreneurs with better stress management and coping abilities (Costa & McCrae, 2008). Therefore, on the grounds of the previous studies (Arora & Rangnekar, 2016), we place that:

H1d: Emotional Stability is positively related to entrepreneurs’ resilience.

Openness to experience
Openness to Experience refers to individuals who tend to be intellectual, imaginative, sensitive, and open-minded (Judge et al., 1998). These characteristics are relevant for both starting a new business venture and for firm’s survival. Indeed, openness is an essential factor for entrepreneurs, as it might hold a prominent role in the process of discovering entrepreneurial opportunities (Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Baron, 2007). Entrepreneurs should be ready for changes in the environment (e.g., markets, products/services, and technology). The act of change needs intelligence and curiosity to obtain new knowledge of technological processes, and innovative thinking to implement new business strategies (Antoncic et al., 2015). Resilience is tightly tied to higher levels of change acceptance (Wanberg & Banas, 2000). Accordingly, we expect that higher levels of openness will lead to greater entrepreneurial resilience. Drawing upon the earlier considerations, we guessed the following research hypothesis (Fig. 1):

H1e: Openness to Experience is positively related to entrepreneur’s resilience.

Prior research has predominantly examined the impact of isolated personality dimensions (John & Srivastava, 1999). However, theories like the Cybernetic Big Five Theory advocate for the integrative effects of personality traits on complex behaviours (DeYoung, 2015), supporting the idea that traits might synergistically interact to influence behaviour. In this vein, while individual personality traits might play a significant role in shaping entrepreneurial resilience, the interplay among these traits could provide a more nuanced understanding of resilience mechanisms. The combined influence of traits such as conscientiousness and emotional stability on resilience may be substantial, as these traits do not operate in isolation but interact to shape complex behaviours and outcomes (McCrae & Costa, 1987). This integrative view is supported by findings that demonstrate the predictive power of combined personality dimensions across various life domains, including stress responses and adaptive behaviours (Bleidorn & Denissen, 2015), which are central to resilience. Further reinforcing this perspective, integrative studies have shown that the interplay between different personality traits can significantly enhance psychological well-being and adaptability, which are critical to managing entrepreneurial challenges (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2014). Thus, we propose the following hypothesis for our study:

H1f: Personality Traits are positively related to entrepreneurs’ resilience.

Beyond personality: the moderating role of prior experience
In the academic audience on entrepreneurship, it is highly shared that background, entrepreneurs’ traits, and previous experience have a bearing on the venture they create (Beckman & Burton, 2008; Bryant, 2014). In this context, there is an increasing acknowledgment of the importance of not only focusing on entrepreneurs’ inherent traits but also integrating a more nuanced understanding that includes cognition, particularly as it is shaped and informed by their individual experiences. Indeed, while these personality traits are undeniably significant, is needed to focus also on the dynamic changes and growth brought about by experiential learning. Unlike innate personality traits, an entrepreneur’s experiences contribute to the evolution of their cognitive framework, shaping their perceptions, decision-making processes, and ultimately, their entrepreneurial actions (Baron, 1998; Hayton & Cholakova, 2012). An entrepreneur’s experience, especially those gained from prior entrepreneurial endeavours, with its unique set of challenges and opportunities, stands out as a crucial element in shaping an entrepreneur’s cognition (Baron, 2007; Okyireh & Okyireh, 2020). This experience is not just about acquiring skills or knowledge; it’s about undergoing a transformative process that reshapes how entrepreneurs perceive risks, opportunities, and their own capabilities. Such experiences deepen their understanding of the entrepreneurial landscape, enhance their problem-solving skills, and refine their decision-making processes (Okyireh & Okyireh, 2020). This experiential learning closely aligns with the concept of resilience, as it involves navigating uncertainties, overcoming setbacks, and adapting to new realities - all key aspects of building resilience.

Therefore, when considering the evolution of an entrepreneur’s cognitive abilities, it is essential to take into account the impact of previous entrepreneurial experiences which provide a real-world context where traits are tried out and resilience is built, offering invaluable insights into the entrepreneurial path. The previous entrepreneurial experience regards the amount of prior new venture engagements including the level of the management role conveyed in such firms (Stuart & Abetti, 1990). Its effectiveness in several areas of business management, such as strategy (Amaral et al., 2011; Gundry & Welsch, 2001; Zucchella et al., 2007), finance (Romano et al., 2001), governance (Deeds et al., 2000) was highlighted. By integrating these experiences into our understanding of entrepreneurial cognition, we gain a more comprehensive view of the factors that drive entrepreneurial strategy and the development of resilience.

Thereon, we supposed the following hypotheses:

H2a: Prior experience positively moderates the relationship between Extraversion and entrepreneur’s resilience;

H2b: Prior experience positively moderates the relationship between Agreeableness and entrepreneur’s resilience;

H2c: Prior experience positively moderates the relationship between Conscientiousness and entrepreneur’s resilience;

H2d: Prior experience positively moderates the relationship between Emotional Stability entrepreneur’s resilience;

H2e: Prior experience positively moderates the relationship between Openness to Experience and entrepreneurs’ resilience.

H2f: Prior experience positively moderates the relationship between the combination of Personality Traits and entrepreneurs’ resilience.

Research methodology and data
Depiction of the sample
This study rests on primary data gathered from entrepreneurs of startups placed in Italy, focusing on firms that are ten years old or less (McDougall et al., 1994). Examining startups allows us to carry out a deeper understanding of the early stage in the entrepreneurial process, namely when the influence of entrepreneurial features is more significant (Bryant, 2014; Nelson, 2003). Furthermore, startups typically face major challenges and uncertainties, especially in their formative years, making them an ideal context for studying resilience. This early stage is marked by high failure rates and intense pressures, necessitating a resilient mindset to navigate obstacles and sustain business operations (Rauch & Frese, 2007; Shepherd et al., 2019). By focusing on startups, we ensure that our sample includes firms where resilience is critically tested and thus, can provide richer insights into how personality traits and previous experience influence entrepreneurial resilience in challenging environments.

The methodological process was conducted in three stages. Firstly, we selected the firms managed and owned by individual entrepreneurs, set up over the last ten years and situated in Italy. Following other scholars (Van Stel et al., 2020), the choice to focus on such a kind of entrepreneur is due to the idea that the effect of personality traits on resilience is above other types of firms.

Building on the earlier literature (Caloghirou et al., 2004; Laursen & Salter, 2014; Venkatraman, 1989), the second step was devoted to the data collection which was carried out by a survey. The questionnaire consists of two sections: the first embraces ancillary questions (general information over interviewees, such as age, gender, and education) that were then used as control variables; the second mostly involves focused questions, especially, entrepreneur’s resilience personality traits, and prior experience in entrepreneurship. The survey (see Table B1 in the Appendix B) was disseminated by an interactive online chatbot. The rate of response was moderately high (19%) considering that online survey is often judged to be spam. The survey was working from July to November 2022 and was spread in both Italian and English language.

Aftermath, the last step was dedicated to performing the quantitative analysis on a sample of 141 Italian startup entrepreneurs.

Variables description and measures
The variables adopted in our research design were mainly measured with scales previously used in literature (Gosling et al., 2003; Sinclair & Wallston, 2004). Furthermore, several control measures were applied to safeguard the regression model. Based on extant entrepreneurship literature (Hornsby et al., 2002; Koe Hwee Nga & Shamuganathan, 2010), dependent and independent variables were measured through 7-point Likert scale. The description of the variables is shown as follows:

Dependent variable
Entrepreneur’s resilience is the entrepreneur’s ability to overcome challenging business conditions (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). The variable was measured following Sinclair & Wallston’s (2004) brief resilience coping scale, which is a 4-items, 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from “does not describe me at all” to “describes me very well”. The label is resilience.

Independent variable
Personality traits were measured through the Ten-Item Personality Inventory-(TIPI), proposed by Gosling et al. (2003), which consists of five items: extraverted; agreeableness; conscientiousness; emotional stability; openness to experience. Each of the five items was classified on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) using the common stem ‘‘I see myself as:’’ (see Appendix B). The labels are respectively extraversion; agreeableness; conscientiousness; emotionalstability; openness.

Moderating variables
Prior experience in entrepreneurship was measured by asking respondents to point out if they had prior experience as entrepreneurs. A dummy variable is equal to 1 when the entrepreneur is a serial entrepreneur and equal to zero otherwise. The label is prior_experience.

Control variables
In our quantitative study, the level of education was coded as 1 if respondents stated their highest level of education as a high school diploma, 2 for a bachelor’s degree, 3 for Masters’s degree, and 4 for PhD. The label is education.

A dummy variable equal to 1 when the entrepreneur is female and zero otherwise has been employed as a control variable too. The label is gender.

Each interviewees indicated his/her age, which was coded with a value equal to: 1 if it ranged from 18 to 24 years; 2 for values between 25 and 34 years old; 3 for entrepreneurs aged between 35 and 44 years old; 4 for values between 45 and 54; 5 for founders’ age ranging from 55 to 64; and 6 for entrepreneurs older than 65 years. The label is age.

Empirical analysis
The hypotheses were tested for moderation using the PROCESS macro in SPSS (Version 29.0) with bootstrapping (5,000 samples; 95% confidence intervals). The macro implements ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to estimate the direct and indirect effects in mediation and moderation models. It allows the assessment of complex interactions and conditional effects, providing a robust framework for testing moderated mediation hypotheses (Hayes, 2017). In our context, the use of bootstrapping is appropriate as it does not rely on the assumption of normality, providing more robust and reliable confidence intervals for the indirect effects, especially in smaller samples (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). This method has been widely adopted in entrepreneurship research for its ability to elucidate complex relationships and interactions (e.g., Salameh, 2022; Abid et al., 2021; Baluku et al., 2016).

We conducted our first analyses using factor scores derived from a Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) analysis with an Oblimin rotation. The PAF method was chosen because it is particularly suitable in cases where variables are expected to be influenced by latent constructs, such as measuring underlying psychological traits (Costello & Osborne, 2005). The choice of Oblimin rotation was appropriate given our expectation of potential correlations between factors, as it allows for correlated factors, reflecting more accurately the complexity of personality traits (Fabrigar et al., 1999). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity were used to verify the suitability of the data for factor analysis, ensuring that the data met the necessary assumptions for a reliable factor analysis (Bartlett, 1954; Kaiser, 1974). Subsequently, we conducted PROCESS analyses on the derived factors, using prior experience as a moderator and controlling for age, gender, and education.

In our second analysis, each personality trait was independently analyzed as the focal predictor with prior experience as the moderator, resulting in five separate analyses. This approach allowed us to isolate the unique contribution of each personality trait to resilience and understand how prior experience moderates these relationships. Motivating our approach, previous research has demonstrated the importance of examining individual personality traits separately to understand their distinct roles in influencing outcomes (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Hossain et al., 2024; Judge et al., 1998; Postigo et al., 2021; Salameh et al., 2022). Aggregating personality traits into a single factor can obscure the unique effects of each trait, making it difficult to identify specific pathways through which personality influences resilience (DeYoung, 2006). By testing each trait independently, we were able to capture the nuanced ways in which different aspects of personality interact with prior experience to affect resilience, providing a clearer and more detailed understanding of these dynamics.

We employed Model 1 of the PROCESS macro to examine the interaction effects of each personality trait (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness) and prior experience on the dependent variable (resilience). Control variables included gender, age, education, and the other personality traits.

We also performed the Breusch-Pagan Test to detect heteroscedasticity (Breusch & Pagan, 1979) and calculated the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to check for multicollinearity among the predictors (O’brien, 2007), ensuring the reliability and validity of our analyses. This step was crucial to validate the robustness and consistency of our findings.

Results
Table 1 exhibits the descriptive statistics. Specifically, the personality traits variables (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional_stability, openness) have a mean score ranging from 7 to 14. Dependent variable (i.e., resilience) results range between 2 and 28. The maximum value of the entrepreneur’s age is equal to 5, with reference to the 55–64 age category; while the higher education, in terms of degree, is equal to 4, corresponding to PhD; and finally, gender is a dummy variable, used as a control variable.

Table 2 shows the Pearson correlation coefficients that were calculated only between the independent and control variables to verify for multicollinearity issues. In more detail, the outputs reveal a non-relevant statistical significance. To validate such results, in the following OLS regression models, we also computed the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) tests.

We conducted our first analyses using factor scores derived from a Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) analysis with an Oblimin rotation (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6A in the Appendix A). This approach was selected to capture potential correlations between factors, which more accurately reflect the complexity of personality traits (Fabrigar et al., 1999). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.546, and such was above the acceptance threshold of 0.50. The Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was significant (χ2 = 40.700, p-value < 0.001), indicating the data’s suitability for factor analysis (Bartlett, 1954; Kaiser, 1974).

The communalities showed that emotional stability had the highest extraction value (0.840), followed by openness (0.564), conscientiousness (0.308), extraversion (0.128), and agreeableness (0.097). Two factors were extracted, explaining 59.12% of the total variance. The first factor explained 34.98% of the variance and the second factor explained an additional 24.13%. The rotated factor matrix revealed the loadings for each trait.

Emotional stability and conscientiousness loaded significantly on Factor 1, while openness and extraversion loaded significantly on Factor 2. Agreeableness exhibits lower loadings across both factors. The factors were weakly correlated (r = 0.050). The factor structure observed in our analysis aligns with the Cybernetic Big Five Theory proposed by DeYoung (2015), which conceptualizes personality traits within two major domains: Stability and Plasticity. According to this theory, Stability encompasses traits that enhance psychological and interpersonal equilibrium, including emotional stability, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. Plasticity, on the other hand, refers to the propensity toward exploring new experiences and adaptive flexibility, characterized mainly by openness and extraversion.

Subsequently, we conducted PROCESS analyses considering the derived factors. In the analysis for Factor 1 (FAC1), we employed prior experience as a moderator and controlled for age, gender, and education, we also included Factor 2 (FAC2) as a control variable to isolate the unique effect of Factor 1 on resilience.

The moderated regression analysis (Table 3) indicated that the overall model was significant, explaining 22.95% of the variance in resilience (R² = 0.2295; F(7,72) = 3.0644; p = 0.0070). Notably, the direct effect of FAC1 on resilience was not significant (B = 0.0346; p = 0.9609), indicating that FAC1 by itself does not have a straightforward impact on resilience. Importantly, the interaction between FAC1 and prior experience was significant (B = 1.9260; p = 0.0505), suggesting that prior experience positively moderates the relationship between the combination of personality traits in FAC1 and resilience. This moderation effect was further highlighted by the conditional effect results; at higher levels of prior experience, the impact of FAC1 on resilience became significantly positive (B = 1.9606; p = 0.0047). Additionally, significant effects were observed for gender (B = − 3.0430; p = 0.0237) and FAC2 (B = 1.3898; p = 0.0269), indicating their influence on resilience. These results validate H2f for FAC1, suggesting that prior experience acts as a critical enhancer of the impact of stability-oriented personality traits on resilience.

For FAC2 as the independent variable, which represents traits linked Openness and Extraversion, there is no significant direct effect on resilience and no significant moderated effect by prior experience. This means that neither FAC2 alone nor in combination with prior experience significantly predicts resilience.

Interestingly, the significance of FAC2 is only observed in the first model where it acts as a covariate alongside the interaction between FAC1 and prior experience. This suggests that the impact of FAC2 may be contingent upon the inclusion and specific interaction of FAC1 with prior experience.

In our sequential analysis, we examine the effects of each personality trait separately, providing a more granulated analysis of the impact of each on resilience. Models 1–2 focused on conscientiousness and emotional stability, respectively, each considering prior experience as a moderator, while controlling for age, gender, education and other personality traits. Notably, both models revealed that while conscientiousness and emotional stability alone did not predict resilience significantly, their interactions with prior experience did show significant positive effects.

Indeed, the analysis of the moderated effect of conscientiousness on resilience (H2c) revealed a significant interaction with prior experience (Table). The overall model (Table 4) was significant, explaining 28.06% of the variance in resilience (R2 = 0.2806; F(10,69) = 2.6912; p-value < 0.05). Although conscientiousness alone did not significantly predict resilience (p-value above the threshold of 0.01) rejecting H1c, the interaction between conscientiousness and prior experience was significant (B = 1.1366, p-value = 0.0249). This indicates that prior experience moderates the relationship between conscientiousness and resilience, with conscientiousness having a stronger positive effect on resilience at higher levels of prior experience, thus confirming H2c.

In Model 2, Table 5, we analysed the moderated effect of emotional stability on resilience. The overall model explained 26.37% of the variance in resilience (R2 = 0.2637; F(10,69) = 2.4712; p-value = 0.0137). Emotional stability on its own did not significantly predict resilience (p-value above the threshold of 0.01), rejecting H1d. However, the interaction between emotional stability and prior experience was statistically significant at the 0.01 level (B = 0.6978; p-value = 0.0637), suggesting that the effect of emotional stability on resilience might be contingent on the level of prior experience, confirming H2d.

These findings align with the composition of Factor 1 from our factor analysis, which included both traits and demonstrated a significant variance explained in resilience, underscoring the importance of stability-related traits in fostering resilience, particularly when augmented by experience.

In contrast, our findings for openness and extraversion, which loaded significantly on Factor 2, did not show significant effects on resilience, either alone or in combination with prior experience. This is consistent with our initial factor analysis results, where Factor 2 explained less variance in resilience compared to Factor 1. The non-significant influence of these traits, known for their association with adaptability and novelty seeking (as aspects of Plasticity), might suggest that in the context of resilience, the stabilizing traits (Factor 1) play a more critical role than traits associated with Plasticity, particularly in the absence of moderating factors like prior experience. Furthermore, the model related to agreeableness did not show any statistical significance, highlighting its moderated loading across both factors. This lack of significance in predicting resilience, either alone or through interaction with prior experience, suggests that agreeableness may have a more complex or diffuse influence that is not as directly impactful on resilience as other traits.

For all models, the mean VIF, in each of them, is moreover hugely far from the critical threshold of 10 (Hair, 2014). In other words, the multicollinearity does not represent a material weakness for the reliability of the findings. The results from the Breusch-Pagan Test suggest no significant evidence of heteroscedasticity (F = 1.023, p = 0.410).

Discussion and conclusive remarks
Over recent years, there has been a growing interest in entrepreneurial resilience within startup settings (Haase & Eberl, 2019; Roundy et al., 2017). The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to several challenges in the global scenario, resulting in significant changes (Kuckertz et al., 2020). In such a context, entrepreneurial resilience might be the “keystone” in enduring and surviving the changing environment.

Drawing upon this increasing academic focus, the present manuscript faces the research questions of whether entrepreneurial resilience is affected by personality traits within the realm of Italian startups. Grounded in the tenets of the RVB, our results expand the ongoing academic debate by highlighting the significance of individual-level characteristics and cognitive dimensions in entrepreneurship literature (Antoncic et al., 2015; Marcati et al., 2008; Salmony & Kanbach, 2022). Precisely, our analysis emphasizes the multifaced relationship between the Big Five personality traits and entrepreneurial resilience as well as taking into account the role exerted by previous experience in entrepreneurship. Such findings pave the way for some captivating reflections.

First, our findings prove that among the Big Five personality traits, conscientiousness and emotional stability significantly influence entrepreneurial resilience, both independently and in combination. On the one hand, a conscientious attitude of entrepreneurs - portrayed as diligent, reliable, and goal-oriented - helps startups implement effective coping strategies in adverse situations. On the other hand, entrepreneurs with strong individual autonomy are better equipped to maintain long-term relationships with key stakeholders and exhibit robust risk-taking abilities (Ciavarella et al., 2004; Schlaegel et al., 2021).

As proven by our empirical evidence, these traits positively impact the entrepreneur’s resilience over time. Those who can nurture and deepen trusted relationships with competitors, customers, suppliers, and stakeholders have more resources to handle adverse situations (Hara & Kanai, 1994; Partanen et al., 2020). Furthermore, entrepreneurs who are particularly diligent, responsible, organized, and able to take risks further strengthen their resilience. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies ceased operations due to overwhelming debt. Recent research by Didier et al. (2021) highlights that industries such as restaurants, retail stores, and service firms (e.g., hospitality and leisure) were most affected by the restrictions, which inevitably impacted their balance sheets. In such a scenario, the capacity of the firm to persist during the pandemic crisis strictly depends on its ability to make significant strategic investments and establish relationships of trust to access funding. Indeed, some sectors, like e-commerce, telecommunications, streaming services, food delivery, health and wellness, and technology, saw certain firms make strategic investment decisions during this challenging period. These companies thrived by investing in their infrastructure, expanding their services, and adapting to the changing market demands, despite the adverse circumstances.

Second, prior entrepreneurial experience provides entrepreneurs with knowledge and skills that can amplify the positive effects of emotional stability and conscientiousness. In particular, an entrepreneur with prior experience can more effectively handle decision-making, risk and relationship management, as well as adaptability and innovation. From one side, considering the positive effect of the interaction between emotional stability and prior experience on resilience, entrepreneurs who effectively leverage their emotional stability can make calm and rational decisions, which inexperienced entrepreneurs might struggle with. They are better at evaluating risks and understanding market dynamics, even during crises, by turning potential threats into opportunities. Additionally, they manage relationships with stakeholders more advantageously, thanks to their self-controlled approach, especially in conflict resolution. Finally, they exhibit greater adaptability in changing circumstances due to their flexibility and openness to innovation, allowing them to quickly adjust strategies and stay competitive. On the other side, regarding the positive impact of the interaction between conscientiousness and prior experience on resilience, experienced entrepreneurs can strategically apply their organizational skills gained from past mistakes and successes, allowing for more efficient resource allocation. They are better at developing robust contingency plans to handle difficult scenarios and mitigate risks effectively. Additionally, their conscientious attitude combined with prior experience enhances interactions by building and maintaining long-term relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners. Lastly, experienced entrepreneurs adopt an organized approach that ensures innovations are not only creative but also practical and scalable.

Additionally, while openness to experience and extraversion did not show significant individual impacts, their effect on resilience emerges when they are considered together. This result suggests that their influence might not be captured when examined in isolation and further highlights the importance of considering both individual and combined effects of personality traits, as well as the critical role of prior experience in enhancing the positive impacts of certain traits.

To infer, while this study aims to contribute to the academic debate on how personality traits and prior experience affect entrepreneurial resilience, it also highlights the importance of considering further questions related to the VRIN resources that companies can exploit through strategic business planning. This contribution offers valuable insights from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

Theoretical and practical contributions
This study aims to significantly contribute to the entrepreneurship literature by elucidating the nuanced interplay between personality traits, prior entrepreneurial experience, and entrepreneurial resilience, thereby enhancing the theoretical framework of RVB (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984). Specifically, our empirical evidence underscores the conceptualization of entrepreneurial resilience as a VRIN resource that integrates both inherent personality traits and the transformative potential of experiential learning (Baron, 2007; Ucbasaran et al., 2010).

By demonstrating that certain personality traits, both independently and when grouped together, contribute to entrepreneurial resilience, along with the significant moderating effect of prior entrepreneurial experience, our research enriches the understanding of resilience’s psychological foundations within the entrepreneurial context. The analysis underscores the crucial role of personality traits and emphasizes how prior experience can enhance their positive impact. These insights contribute to the ongoing debate on integrating cognition and personality in entrepreneurship literature, highlighting that both inherent psychological traits and cognitive experiences are essential in fostering resilience. By focusing on the dual impact of an entrepreneur’s psychological makeup and their experiential learning processes, this study underscores the necessity of considering both aspects to fully understand and enhance the resilience, strategic adaptability, and innovation capacity of startups.

Furthermore, our research highlights the interconnection between individual resilience and broader organisational capabilities, suggesting that the former is a key determinant of the latter. By combining these individual-level factors into the conceptual framework of RVB, we propose a nuanced perspective that recognises the influence of entrepreneurial resilience in the realm of key internal strategic resources. This outlook encourages a reevaluation of a set of prominent resources to include a more tailored approach, where the entrepreneur’s psychological makeup and experiential background are seen as critical components in shaping firm’s strategic responses to changing market conditions and emerging challenges. Therefore, the resilience of entrepreneurs could considerably contribute to the resilience of the ventures they run, enabling these businesses to better navigate and overcome adverse conditions. Indeed, framing resilience as a VRIN resource aligns our study with seminal work by scholars who have illuminated the critical influence of entrepreneurial resilience on firm’s strategic trajectory and performance (Linnenluecke, 2017; Teece, 2007). By delving into the antecedents of resilience, our research offers a foundational examination of how entrepreneurial personality and cognition translate into resilience, paving the way for a deeper understanding of capabilities, and leading a reappraisal of the factors that enable entrepreneurs and their ventures to thrive in disruptive events. The study underscores that these traits are inimitable and non-substitutable, as they are deeply rooted in the entrepreneur’s psychological makeup and cannot be easily replicated by competitors (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984).

Our findings not only enrich the theoretical understanding of entrepreneurial resilience but also provide practical implications for developing training and support programs aimed at enhancing resilience among entrepreneurs through targeted experience-building and personality development interventions. In particular, entrepreneurial education should incorporate experiential learning approaches that challenge individuals in controlled contexts, thereby fostering resilience. Such educational frameworks could include scenario-based learning, simulations of entrepreneurial challenges, and reflective practices that spur learners to deeply engage with the uncertainties and dynamics of entrepreneurship (Neck & Greene, 2011; Pittaway & Cope, 2007). These experiences are instrumental in developing a mindset that not only perseveres through adversities but also learns and adapts from them, reinforcing the resilience process. Moreover, the above-mentioned programs could facilitate networking opportunities, allowing entrepreneurs to share experiences and learn from each other, further reinforcing the resilience-building process. The creation of a community of practice among entrepreneurs, where experiences and strategies for overcoming challenges are openly discussed, can significantly enhance the collective resilience of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (Wenger, 2008). By nurturing such ecosystems, educational institutions and support organizations can substantially help entrepreneurs navigate the complexities and uncertainties of the entrepreneurial path, thereby contributing to more robust and adaptable business ventures.

By acknowledging that resilience, influenced by prior experiences, is pivotal for a venture’s ability to adapt and thrive, investors and other stakeholders in the startup ecosystem can derive value from these insights. They can more effectively evaluate both the long-term viability and potential success of a startup (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Teece, 2007). This insight needs a shift on how early entrepreneurial experiences, including changes in business direction due to initial poor decisions, are perceived. Rather than considering these experiences as negative marks on an entrepreneur’s record, they should be recognized as valuable enablers means to build resilience. Such experiences, which may involve handling failures or strategic pivots, are not detractors but rather enhancers of entrepreneur’s capacity to persevere and adapt in the face of future challenges. Such reappraisal pushes investors to consider the resilience of the entrepreneurial team, informed by a history of learning from setbacks, as a critical factor in investment decisions. By focusing not only on the business model and market opportunity, but also on the proven resilience of the entrepreneurial team, investors can make more informed assessments of a startup’s potential for long-term success.

Moreover, the study attempts to bring policy implications by promoting an enabling institutional environment able to recognize and reinforce the value of entrepreneurial resilience This encompasses the crafting of a corporate culture that supports risk-taking, learning from failure, and continuous adaptation, all of which are essential components of resilience (Cope, 2005; McGrath & MacMillan, 2000). In a similar scenario, within a supportive ecosystem, stakeholders can bestow the development of more sturdy and adaptable entrepreneurial ventures capable of generating economic growth and innovation.

To infer, our research offers valuable insights for entrepreneurs, support organizations, policymakers, allowing them to create conducive conditions for successful and resilient startup ventures. Emphasizing the development of specific personality traits and the accumulation of relevant experiences, the practical implications allow to equip the entrepreneurial ecosystem with the needed tools to navigate the intricacies and uncertainties of the contemporary business landscape.

Limitations and future research directions
Although our study seeks to feed the academic debate through theoretical and practical implications, some limitations warrant mention and suggest directions for future research. Firstly, as shown in similar studies (Podsakoff et al., 2003; Zighan et al., 2022), the cross-sectional design of our study limits our ability to capture the dynamic evolution of resilience over time (Doni et al., 2019). Adopting an evolutionary approach, longitudinal studies could seize the evolution of entrepreneurial resilience over time and provide invaluable insights into its dynamic nature by investigating how resilience develops, fluctuates, and impacts business outcomes across different stages of startup’s lifecycle (Meyer et al., 2005). From this standpoint, future studies can explore this relationship by using the Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT) that enables to better catch the dynamics within the realm of capabilities and experience.

Secondly, the focus on Italian startups may restrict the generalizability of our results over different cultural and economic contexts, thus expanding the geographic scope of research would enhance the findings’ portability related to entrepreneurial resilience. For instance, comparative studies across a diverse array of countries and cultures could uncover how different entrepreneurial ecosystem conditions might influence the development and manifestation of resilience in entrepreneurs (Roundy & Bayer, 2019; Zahra, 2007).

Thirdly, the use of self-reported measures for assessing personality traits and resilience introduces the possibility of response bias, a common issue in behavioural research (Bullough et al., 2014; Furnham, 1986). Future studies could employ objective measures or third-party assessments to provide a more nuanced view of how personality and resilience manifest in entrepreneurial contexts (Conway & Lance, 2010). Overall, integrating primary and secondary data could mitigate potential biases and offer a deeper understanding of the interplay between personality traits, experiences, and resilience (Chunsheng et al., 2019). This approach might also ease the examination of resilience’s impact on tangible business performance metrics. Additionally, there are various ways to measure resilience, which could represent a limitation for our study. Different resilience scales and assessment tools may capture distinct aspects of this complex construct (Windle, 2011). Future research could compare the outcomes of various resilience measurement methods to validate and extend our findings, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial resilience.

Besides, our study’s focus on the Big Five personality traits and prior experience does not encompass other factors, such as social support networks, industry-specific challenges, or access to resources that could affect entrepreneurial resilience. Incorporating these variables could yield a more comprehensive model of resilience in entrepreneurship (Morris et al., 2011). Still, the emphasis on the moderating role of prior entrepreneurial experience does not explore the diversity of these experiences in depth. The lessons learned from various entrepreneurial endeavours could essentially affect resilience development (Ucbasaran et al., 2010). Qualitative research or mixed-method approaches could elucidate the complex ways different for which types of entrepreneurial experiences contribute to resilience (Edmondson & Mcmanus, 2007). Last but not least, due to the narrow number of observations and the inadequacy of the regression model, we were unable to perform Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) (Ding et al., 1995). We suggest that future studies consider latent constructs such as entrepreneurial orientation and explore how these can affect resilience.

To sum, while our study advances the understanding of entrepreneurial resilience as an inherent attitude shaped by personality and experience, we recommend further research in this field to address the identified research gaps. Future studies addressing the gaps above mentioned have the potential to extremely enrich both theoretical and practical knowledge of resilience in entrepreneurship, offering valuable insights for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and scholars.
